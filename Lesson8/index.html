        roots in a
        piece
        of
        classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.
        Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of
        the
        more
        obscure
        Latin words,
        consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical
        literature,
        discovered the undoubtable source.
        Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The
        Extremes
        of
        Good
        and
        Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.
        This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first
        line
        of
        Lorem
        Ipsum,
        "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</div>
